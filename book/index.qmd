## Transition to a Systematic Decision  Framework {-}

By 2025, the project evolved from a purely empirical ML framework into a Bayesian system that integrates mechanistic crop simulations with field observations. Rather than asking whether multi-field data alone can predict yield–N responses, the central question became: **How can the APSIM^[Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator] generate scientifically grounded prior yield–N distributions for a region, and how can OFPE trials update these priors to produce field-specific posterior responses?**

## Contents {-}

This book reflects that progression.  
The chapter *Tree Ensemble Prediction (2022)* revisits the original tree-model analysis and its limitations.  
The chapter *Bayesian–Hierarchical Analysis (2025)* develops the Bayesian–APSIM framework, showing how mechanistic priors and OFPE field trials can be combined to produce uncertainty-aware and biologically interpretable yield–N distributions.
